# PDSC-database CMSIS-Pack Version 1.6.0
SQLite database implementing PDSC standard rules by ARM
database based on CMSIS-Pack Version 1.6.0

I've created an app for STMicroelectronics that helps programmers to create PDSC files.
I can't public the app's source code, but I think that this database could be useful for other projects.
